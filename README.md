# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-week-4-project
My submission for week 4's project, which has been a long and arduous task for me to complete. I'm very glad that I've gotten this far, and I hope y'all like the work!
This submission is made up of 4 files: this readme, a codebook (CodeBook.md), the file analysis r program (run_analysis.R), and the file of data after all 5 steps(combinefinal.txt)
